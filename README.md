Munchhausen
===========

Social network jamming technologies

In Munchausen syndrome, the affected person exaggerates or creates symptoms in herself to get attention, treatment and sympathy. In extreme cases, people with this syndrome have a high knowledge of medicine and can produce symptoms for unnecessary operations. For example, one can inject into a vein infected material, causing infection and prolonging their stay in hospital. It is different from hypochondriasis, the patient with Munchausen know you're exaggerating, while the hypochondriac believes is sick indeed.

This is a proof of concept. I do not know the exact way to build this device, but I decided to share it here, hoping that someone more qualified to carry out an idea.

The large media conglomerates and information are firmly committed to collect much information on our behalf. Cameras and cell phones with GPS, various social networks, capture and analysis links the time of visitation at sites ... All this serves to map and predict behavior.

Behind the smokescreen used to conceal the process occurred with Assange, Wikileaks and members of the hive known as Anonymous, are being employed techniques of restriction of freedom through the use of information obtained through these large corporations the internet.

Thus, operators of digital payment blocked the financial transactions of Wikileaks. Thus it was possible to find the person responsible for Megaupload. So they have found some members of Anonymous.

Obviously there are ways to maintain privacy, encryption using specific tools. But the origin of these tools and their effectiveness can not be proved by most people.

Münchhausen proposes is a technology called scrambling profile, it will be impossible to predict behavior.

How would that work?

The software would perform a search in Adwords service, searching hundreds of thousands of words, images and videos with high search index. Then an operator syntax would generate meaningful sentences with these words and begin a massive post on all social networks belonging to a particular user. The hidden links on each post would point to pages that disseminariam infection in other profiles, to that social networks were saturated with irrelevant information about people.

A second module of this software is GPS Scrambler. In fact, the software would change the EXIF ​​tags of images posted by the user generating locations with latitude and longitude random, making it impossible to know the location where the photos were taken. Thus, social networks lose their power to determine its location through the photos you put in some time.

The third module alter the general profile information such as date of birth, place of birth, family relationships, profile pictures, photo tags, etc ...

Infecting

The APIs provided by social networks have commands that capture the user's information, with consent and submit to certain software in its network.

The first version of this software could be a SCAM of some other popular existing software. After the first run, the software would track in their own social network which are the most used software and clicked by users, generating multiple copies of the same software as the most popular software scams. The spread was very rapid.
